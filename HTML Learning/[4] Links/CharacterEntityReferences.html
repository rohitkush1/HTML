	<p>&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to then man who is actually in the arena, who face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; whp strives valiantly; wjo errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the dees; who knows great enthusoasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthly cause; who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;</p>
