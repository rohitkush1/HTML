    <h3>A friend in need is a friend indeed</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away. On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became friends. They lived happily in the forest afterwards</p>

    <h3>A Town Mouse and A Country Mouse</h3>
    <p>A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were friends. The Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.The flavour was not much to the taste of the guest and presently he broke out with “My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me and I promise you shall live on the fat of the land." So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates.The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided. But before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again. But some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. "Good bye," said he, "I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace."</p>

You can not swing from trees like me."Next, the elephant met a rabbit. He asked him to be his friends.But the rabbit said, “You are too big to play in my burrow!"Then the elephant met a frog.“Will you be my friend? He asked.“How can I?" asked the frog.“You are too big to leap about like me."The elephant was upset. He met a fox next.“Will you be my friend?" he asked the fox.The fox said, “Sorry, sir, you are too big."The next day, the elephant saw all the animals in the forest running for their lives.The elephant asked them what the matter was.The bear replied, “There is a tier in the forest. He’s trying to gobble us all up!"The animals all ran away to hide.The elephant wondered what he could do to solve everyone in the forest.Meanwhile, the tiger kept eating up whoever he could find.The elephant walked up to the tiger and said, “Please, Mr. Tiger, do not eat up these poor animals."“Mind your own business!" growled the tiger.The elephant has a no choice but to give the tiger a hefty kick.The frightened tiger ran for his life.The elephant ambled back into the forest to announce the good news to everyone.All the animals thanked the elephant.They said, “You are just the right size to be our friend."</p>

    <h2>Four Friends</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time in a small village lived four Brahmins named Satyanand, Vidhyanand, Dharmanand and Sivanand. They had grown up together to become good friends. Satyanand, Vidhyanand and Dharmanand were very knowledgeable. But Sivanand spent most of his time eating and sleeping. He was considered foolish by everyone.
    Once famine struck the village. All the crops failed. Rivers and lakes started to dry up. The people of the villages started moving to other villages to save their lives.
    “We also need to move to another place soon or else we will also die like many others," said Satyanand. They all agreed with him.
    “But what about Sivanand?" Asked Satyanand.
    “Do we need him with us? He has no skills or learning. We cannot take him with us," replied Dharmanand. “He will be a burden on us."
    “How can we leave him behind? He grew up with us," said Vidhyanand. “We will share what ever we earn equally among the four of us."
    They all agreed to take Sivanand along with them.
    They packed all necessary things and set out for a nearby town. On the way, they had to cross a forest.
    As they were walking through the forest, they came across the bones of an animal. They became curious and stopped to take a closer look at the bones.
    “Those are the bones of a lion," said Vidhyanand.
    The others agreed.
    “This is a great opportunity to test our learning," said Satyanand.
    “I can put the bones together." So saying, he brought the bones together to form the skeleton of a lion.
    “Dharmanand said, “I can put muscles and tissue on it." Soon a lifeless lion lay before them.
    “I can breathe life into that body." said Vidhyanand.
    But before he could continue, Sivanand jumped up to stop him. “No. Don't! If you put life into that lion, it will kill us all," he cried.
    “Oh you coward! You can’t stop me from testing my skills and learning," shouted an angry Vidhyanand. “You are here with us only because I requested the others to let you come along."
    “Then please let me climb that tree first,’ said a frightened Sivanand running towards the nearest tree. Just as Sivanand pulled himself on to the tallest branch of the tree Vidhyanand brought life into the lion. Getting up with a deafening roar, the lion attacked and killed the three learned Brahmins.

    <h2>The Clever Frog</h2>
    <p>The Deep inside a forest, there was a pond. Many fishes, crabs and frogs lived in the pond. Theirs was a happy and peaceful life.
      Among them lived two beautiful fishes named Sahasrabuddhi and Shatabuddhi. They were bigger than the other fishes in the pond. They were very proud of their good looks and intelligence.
      In the same pond lived a frog with his wife. His name was Ekkabuddhi. The fishes and frogs were good friends. They all led an undisturbed life.
      But one day two fishermen, returning from the river in the forest after fishing. came across the pond. It was late in the evening and as usual all the fishes and frogs were at play. Sahasrabuddhi, Shatabuddhi, Ekkabuddhi and many others joined the game. They leaped high into the air and chased each other.
      Seeing the beautiful scene the fishermen were amazed and stopped in their tracks.
      “How beautiful they look?" said one fisherman.
      “Yes. And so many of them too," replied the other.
      “The pond does not look very deep," said the first fisherman. “Let us catch some of them."
      “It is already very late and we have a heavy load to carry a long way. Let’s come back tomorrow," suggested the other fisherman.
      Ekkabuddhi turned to the others in the pond and said, “Did you not hear what the fishermen said? We must leave this pond for a safer place."
      “Just because two fishermen said they would come back to catch us tomorrow, you want us to leave our home and flee. For all we know, they might not come back," said Sahasrabuddhi.
      “Even if they come back to catch us I know a thousand tricks to get away."
      “And even if your thousand ways fail, I know another hundred ways to escape," said Shatabuddhi. “ We will not let two fishermen scare us away from our me." All the others in the pond agreed with them.
      “Well! I know only one trick," said Ekkabuddhi. “To leave the place before danger strikes." Ekkabuddhi and his wife left the pond in search of a safer place. All the fishes, crabs and frogs laughed at them as they left.
      The next day the fishermen returned to the pond and cast their net. “Ouch! This net is too thick for me to bite through," cried Sahasrabuddhi.
      “For me too," cried Shatabuddhi. “Only if I could get out, I could do something.
      “We should have listened to Ekkabuddhi," cried a fish. “Now we are all doomed."
      The fishermen caught them all and put all the fishes, frogs and crabs into a big basket and took them away.
      Ekkabuddhi, hiding behind a boulder with his wife turned to her and said, “If I had not acted in time, we would also be in that basket with the others."
